# COM 234: Public Debate

## Lecture 1, Sept 25

- Syllabus and course info on Canvas
- Three example topics for this quarter:
    - Should elite universities reinstate the SAT?
    - Is Initiative 2124 good for Washingtonians?
    - Be it Resolved, TikTok is a NatSec threat and should be sold or banned.
- Argumentation:
    - "Argumentation is the practice of justifying claims under conditions of uncertainty"
    - We use reasons to justify claims, where claims are assertions where another person's assent is sought
    - We argue over uncertain assertions
- Debate:
    - Debate as the "presentation of mutually exclusive claims by competing advocates to a design maker for adjudication"
    - Normally involves trying to persuade a third party
- Preconditions of argument:
    - Genuine disagreement on a non-trivial matter
    - Seeking agreement from another party
    - No simpler means for resolving the conflict
