- Access to VC funds:
    - Firms often require large fund size
    - You must be an accredited investor
- Accredited investors (per SEC):
    - Net worth over $1,000,000 excluding home
    - Income over $200,000 individually or $300,000 with spouse
- Goal of a VC:
    - Capturing value between the startup phase and public company phase
- Functions of a VC:
    1. Fundraise
    2. Source
    3. Evaluate
    4. Deploy
    5. Manage
- People in the fund:
    - General Partner:
        - Manages the money and operations
        - Must make a commitment of 1-2 percent
    - Limited Partners:
        - Commit the vast majority of the money
        - Are not involved in decision making processes

        - Manage organization as well as money
    - Venture partners:
        - Help with sourcing and evaluating funds
- How do VC funds generate return?
    - To breakeven at 10% success, they need to return 10x
    - To get 3x return on fund, companies need a 30x return
- VC fees:
    - Management fee: annual percentage of assets under management
    - Performance fee: percentage of return of fund
- VC differentiation:
    - Different areas of investment
    - Different fund parameters (e.g. timing or size)
