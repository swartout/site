## Lecture 1 - Jan 4

- 9 topics + a bonus topic, one per week
- One mini-project per week, always due on Wed
    - Can work with partners
- "Power of two choices"
    - Related problem:
        - Put $n$ balls in $n$ bins, i.i.d.
        - "What is the expected number of balls in the most-full bin?"
        - It grows via: $\sim \frac{\log n}{\log \log n}$
    - Two-choice strategy:
        - Chose two bins $i, j \in {1, \dots, n}$ uniformly at random
        - Throw ball in the least loaded of the two!
        - Grows via: $\sim \log \log n$
    - $d$-choices: $\sim \frac{\log \log n}{\log d}$
        - The same "boost" doesn't happen again outside of $1 \rightarrow 2$
