## Lecture 1 - June 20

- Need 14/18 points to pass
- SSH basics: `username@server`
- Unix: developed in the late 60s at Bell Labs
    - Everything is a file!
- Linux: developed in 1992 by Linus
- Why use the CLI? It is often faster and easier!
- `/bin` is where the binaries are stored
- `ls -lh` lists everything in `h`uman-readable format
- We can use the `find` command to *find* files!
    - Starts in your current directory, recursivly searches from there
    - `-name` matches the end of each path
- `man`: manual for commands

---

## Lecture 2 - June 27

- Shell expands all `*` wildcards
- `cat`: con`cat`enate a file to the terminal
- `less`: allows easy viewing of text vim-like
- `head`: print the first lines of a file
- `tail`: print the last lines of a file
    - `-f` flag to keep running file
- `wc`: word count program
    - by default, counts lines, words, then characters
- `sort`: sorts lines alphabetically
- `uniq` collapses adjacent unique lines
    - Typically should `sort` it first
- `grep`: search tool for files
    - First argument is search term, proceding arguments are files to search from
    - Prints each line that matches the search term
- Running java on the command line:
    - `javac ProgramName.java` combiles the program
    - `javac ProgramName` runs the program
    - `java ProgramName.java` compiles and runs the program
- Streams:
    - Standard input: `stdin`
    - Standard output: `stdout`
    - Standard error: `stderr`
- Reads or adds to the *stream* however much is requested
- Use the right waka `>` to redirect standard output to a file
    - Double waka `>>` appends standard output to a file
- Use the left waka `<` to redirect standard input from a file
- Use two waka `2>` to redirect standard error to a file
- Pipes `|`: takes standard output of what's on the left and uses it as standard input on the right
    - Used to chain commands together
- `ctrl-D` to close a program

---

## Lecture 3 - July 4

- `command1 && command2` runs `command2` if `command1` ran successfully
    - Similar to short-circuting evaluations
- `command1 || command2` runs `command2` if `command1` didn't run successfully
- `command1 ; command2` always runs both commands
- Some commands don't read from standard input if none are provided
    - `xargs`: "negotiate" between standard input and passing parameters
    - Command substitution: evaluate what's in a `$(eval)` and substitute
- Append `&1` to use the same as standard output (not as confident)
- `tee` saves standard output to a file *while* still printing it out
- `echo` echos what is passed
- `cut`: cuts up input:
    - `-cRANGE` outputs the RANGE of characters
    - `-dDELIMETER` cuts at the delimeter
    - `-fRANGE` outputs the RANGE of fields
- Standard output and input is buffered, use `stdbuf` to change behavior

## Lecture 4 - July 11

- A repo stores the state (and history) of the project
    - Don't store the compiled files, build somewhere else
- Using a remote repository allows us to have a unified source of truth
- `git status`: display the status of the repo
    - Only working directory and staging area
- `git commit -m "message"`: commits the staged files with the message
- The four stages of git:
    1. Working directory: the local files on your computer
    2. Staging area/idex: changes I'm preparing to commit
    3. Local repository: project changes on my computer
    4. Remote repository: shared and source of truth
- `git add` to add files
- `git log` to view past commits
    - Each commit gets its own hash
    - Use `--decorate --all --graph` to get a visual history of the repository
- `origin master` is where the computer thinks the remote repository is at
- `HEAD` is where we are locally
- `git restore file` to remove local changes
    - Add `--staged` flag to un-stage
- The diffs for files are what is actually tracked, that means a file can be both staged and have unstaged diffs
- `git diff` allows us to view differences between working directory and staging area
    - Add `--staged` flag to view diff between staging area and local repository
- `git help command` displays the man page for `git command`
- `git commit` (no `-m`) allows you to add a commit message on first line, then other info on other lines
- `git pull` "pulls" the remote commits to your local repository
    - Often leads to a "merge commit"
- `git switch -c name` to create a branch and switch to it
- `HEAD` is most recent commit, `HEAD~n` is the commit `n` before `HEAD`

## Lecture 5 - July 18

- `master` or `main` is the "single source of truth", the history of the project
    - The code on `master` should be stable
- Continuous integration (CI): when you push, automated tests verifty it is stable
- Each commit references its parent, somewhat like a linked list
- Branches are pointers referencing commits
    - `master` is the default one
- `HEAD` is the current pointer, where the user is at
    - We can move this to whichever branch we want
- Use `git log --graph --oneline` for a simplified version
- To create a new branch, we use `git branch <branch_name>`
    - The branch is created pointing to wherever `HEAD` is
- To switch branches, we use `git checkout <branch_name>`
    - `HEAD` now points to `<branch_name>`
- `git merge <merge_name>` merges `<merge_name>` into current branch `HEAD`
    - Attemps to auto-merge but runs into conflicts when conflicting diffs
        - Changes the file to show the conflicting diffs, must be resolved
        - To resolve it, we commit like normal
        - `git status` will now give more information on error
- After merging `<branch_name>`, you can `checkout <branch_name>` and `git merge master` to fast-forward to the merge
    - Fast-forward is like moving `HEAD` to the other branch's reference (as it is acting like a linked list)
- We save the pointers (branches) from our remote (`origin`) repository as well
    - That's what `origin/master` are
- `git fetch` fetches information from the remote repository
- `git pull` is (roughly) `git fetch` and `git merge` in one command
- Merging in practice:
    1. Create a local branch and make some commits
    2. Push those commits to remote
    3. Open a merge request on GitHub/GitLab
    4. Collaborate with others, leave comments, fix conflicts
    5. Merge into master (or other branch)
- Much of the time you can't push directy to `master`
- `git checkout -b <branch_name>` creates a new branch `<branch_name>` and swtiches to it
- When there is a merge conflict in a merge request, (in GitLab) you can make a reconciliation commit in browser
- Finally, you can make the merge commit in the browser
- Use `git branch -d <branch_name>` to remove a branch
- Use `git init` to initialize a git repository
- `HEAD` is the head of the "linked list" that represents the repository
- A **tag** is a fixed reference pointing to a specific tag
- A **branch** is like a tag, but moves as `HEAD` moves
    - Use `git tag <tag_name>` to tag a commit (by default `HEAD`)
- A "deatched head" is a git repository where no branch is associated with it
    - Can happen when checking out something that doesn't have a branch at it
    - This can happen when checking out a tag
- `git rebase` is useful to apply a o

## Lecture 6 - July 25

- A regular expression (regex) is a description of a pattern of text
- This is a common way to search for text
- `grep`: global regular expression print
    - By default, case sensitive: use `-i` to ignore case
    - Passing `-E` to `grep` allows us to use regular expressions
- `.` matches any character
- Use backslash `\` to escape (some?) special characters
- `^` matches the beginning of the line
- `$` matches the end of the line
- "Words" are things that are separated by some amount of whitespace
- `\<` refers to the start of a word
- `\>` refers to the end of a word
- `pattern1|patttern2` searches for `pattern1` or `pattern2`
- `()` groups expressions together 
- `x*` matches any number of `x`s
- `x+` matches one or more `x`s
- `x?` matches zero or one `x`
- `[xyz]` is equivalant to `(x|y|z)`
    - It also makes all characters in the brackets to literals
- `[a-z]`, `[A-Z]`, `[0-9]`, and `[a-zA-Z]` all work as expected
- `x{5}` matches `x` five times in a row
- `x{,5}` matches `x` *up to* five times in a row
- `x{2-5}` and `x{5,}` work as expected
- `[^0-9]` matches any character that is *not* `[0-9]`
- Backreferences allow for capturing and referring to previous patterns
    - `(..)\1` matches any two-character pattern which is repeated

## Lecture 7 - August 1

- `sed -r 's/REGEX/TEXT` does search and replace for text
    - Append with a file name to run it on the file
    - Use the `-i.EXTENSION` flag to change the file and use the `EXTENSION`
- By default, `sed` replaces only the first match on each line
    - To replace with *all* matches on each line, append with `g`: `sed -r 's/REGEX/TEXT/g`
- To use the forward slash, we need to escape it: `\/`
- We can use backreferences in the `TEXT`

---

## Lecture 8 - August 8

- `whoami` prints out your username
- `users` prints out all currently logged in users
    - `pinky` is like `users` but more informative
- `groups` prints all the groups that you belong to
- `ps` prints all the processes you're currently running
    - `-u uname` does that for a `username`
- `top` or `htop` shows system usage with procceses
- `kill PID` kills the process with PID `PID`
- `/usr/bin` holds many of the executable binaries
    - `/usr` stands for universal system resouces
- `sudo`: super user do
- `.bash_profile` is run every time you login
- `.bashrc` is run for every non-login shell
- To make an alias: `alias new_name="command to be ran"`
    - `alias` alone will print all aliases
- `$PATH` is all of the paths that your system will search through for a command
    - Each path is separated by a `:` delimiter
- File permissions: `drwxrwxrwx`
    - If there is a character in a slot, it means that it has that permission
    - First character represents if it is a directory
    - Each following set of three represent if there are read, write, or execute permissions
        - Those sets are owner (`u`), groups (`g`), and others (`o`)
    - Owners of a file can always change the file permissions
- To change permsissions, use the `chomod` command
    - Use `chmod T+P` where `T` is the type of user and `P` is the permission type
    - `chmod T-P` takes away permissions
    - Octal codes allow simple ways to type out permissions for a user type
        - +4 for read, +2 for write, +1 for execute
- Directory permissions:
    - Read: if the person view the directory
    - Write: if the person write to the directory
    - Execute: if the person enter into the directory
- `umask` sets default permissions for new files

## Lecture 9 - August 15

- The first line of a shell script should be the "shebang", `#!/bin/bash`
    - The first line of a Python script should be `#!/bin/python`
- Bash scripts are simply shell commands, executed line-by-line
- Shells run sub-shells, so calling shell state doesn't get changed
    - i.e. bash scripts can't change the calling shells with `cd`
- Bash variables:
    - Create them using `var_name="value"`
    - Reference them with `$var_name`
    - Variables are empty by default
- Single quotes in bash are interpreted as literals, double quotes insert variable names
    - Somewhat similar to f-strings
- Dollar sign number variables (e.g. `$1`) are reserved and bound to arguments
    - `$#` refers to the number of arguments (not including program name)
    - `$@` refers to all the arguments
- Command line substitution: `var_name=$(expression)`
- Sequence command: `$(seq start stop)`
    - Note `stop` is inclusive
- Loop syntax:
    - Start with `for var_name in variable`
    - Begin body with `do`
    - End with `done`
    - It can iterative over command line arguments
- Math in bash:
    - Either use `let` syntax and double quotes
    - Or use `$((expression))`
- If statements:
    - ```
    if [ $a -ge $b ]; then
        echo "a is greater than b"
    fi```
    - Square brackets are interpreted as a test alias
    - Add `else` betwen `then` and `fi` for else
    - Use `elif` for else-if
    - Use `||` to OR expressions together
    - Use `&&` to AND expressions together
- Exit codes:
    - We can use the exit code to know how a program terminated
    - The exit code for the previous command is stored in `$?`
    - Successful exit code is `0`, non-zero exit codes are failures
    - `exit` command sets exit code to zero by default
        - `exit num` sets exit code to `num`
