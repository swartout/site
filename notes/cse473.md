- A search problem cosists of:
    - State space
    - State transition function
    - State space graph
- We make search trees from our state space graphs, just paths from the graph
- Graphs with cycles become infinite search trees
- "Complete" search algorithm: always finds a solution if it exists
- "Optimal" search algorithm: always finds the shortest path between start and

**Search algos:**

- Uninformed
    - DFS, BFS
        - Same search method, different "fringe" (stack vs queue) goal
    - Uniform cost search (UCS):
        - Uses a priority queue
        - Complete and optimal
        - Similar to Dijkstra's
- Heuristics:
    - A *heuristic* estimates how close a state is to a goal
    - Admissibility:
        - Admissible (optimistic): $h(s) \geq 0$ and $h(s) \leq
          \text{true_cost}(s)$
        - Inadmissible (pessimistic) heuristics
    - Greedy search"
        - Use local heurstics
    - A\* search:
        - Order by sum of cost of path to get there plus heuristic
        - Optimal only with admissible heuristics
