**Hi, I'm Carter!**

I'm a CS undergraduate in my final year at the University of Washington. I'm passionate about using AI and other technologies to create a more intelligent world. I'm also the proud older brother of two amazing siblings!

I'm interning with UW HYAK (HPC) through Fall 2024!

I interned at the newly-launched AWS PCS in Summer 2024!
