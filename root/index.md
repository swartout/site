**Hi, I'm Carter!**

I'm a CS undergraduate in my third year at the University of Washington. I'm passionate about using AI and other technologies to create a more intelligent world. I'm also the proud older brother of two amazing siblings!

I'll be interning as a SDE at Amazon in Summer 2024!

Please get in touch with me at **swartout**[at]**uw**[dot]**edu** if you'd like
to chat!
