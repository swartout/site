# Week 1 post (TODO: name) (New Years Goals(?))

I've always found New Year's Goals to be a little silly - why is starting on
this date going to make you more successful? Nevertheless, it is as good of a
time as any to start some new habits.

The biggest thing I want to do this year is focus on what I'm truly interested
in. I'm lucky to have the opportunity to do that and am confident if I do what I
care about, things will work out for me. Unfortunately, over the past year, I
haven't spent as much time doing what I care about as I could (or should).
Here's some of the reasons why I think this is the case:

I've been quite lucky to have few external pressures pushing me away from doing
what I find interesting when growing up. Growing up, I went to an alternative
school, with fewer social pressures. I could read all day if I wanted to, and I
did! Even in high school, there wasn't much pressure to optimize for college, as
it feels like many are pressured into now. While living as an exchange student I
was expected to fail and be a bit of an idiot - as long as I was fully engaged
when there, I was ok!

At UW, I've had my first strong and consistent pressures to optimize for things
that I don't really care about. STARS pushed my cohort to be perfect in classes,
especially getting high grades, trading that off for nearly all non-cousework
activites. UW (CSE especially) has a way of 

- Focusing on school when it doesn't matter or bad school habits taking up too
  much of my time
- Not working consistently enough on projects
- Doing things alone! I get really motivated when I work with or show off to
  others
- Generally, spending time on things that I don't care about (youtube, random
  articles, excessive wikipedia scrolling)
- Not aggressively avoiding things that I'm disinterested in and aren't required

There are many things that I genuinely love, but the last few years have taken
much of the joy out of. I love to learn, but the stress of UW has given
"learning" a bit of a negative connotation. Writing is something I enjoy, yet
the experience of writing for a grade can be nearly intolerable for me. This
year I want to do what I care about.

Goals: (TODO)

- Write a little each day and make a post each week. Some weeks might be
  self-centered (like this one), others will be about things I find interesting,
  or technical subjects!
- Finish a book a month. A couple of friends of mine are joining me in this, I'm
  really looking forward to it. (This first month, I'll be reading "The Worlds I
  See" by Fei-Fei Li.)
- Work on a project (or non-UW class) every day. I'm trying to do about an hour
  a day. I can even write about these each week! Here's some of the things I've
  been working on:
    - Finishing Spinningup by OpenAI
    - Taking MIT's Linalg course by Gilbert Strang
    - Exploring how LLMs can convert text-based game states into the true state
      (my current experiment a LLM to convert the PGN or FEN for chess into true
      positions
- Saying no to things I don't want to do. It's a little weird to not 

I'm incredibly confident that if I do what I care about, I'll be happier, get
more done, and be more succesful (it's worth noting this should be an obviously
apparent statement, yet it feels somewhat abonormal to say).
